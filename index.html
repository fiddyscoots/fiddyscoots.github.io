				<p>There are many songs in this world. Some are good, some are 106% garbage. <br>
				Obviously, my taste in music is flawless. That is why I'm using math, science, and plain old common sense to <br>
				put together....</p>
					
					<h2>My most favourite song of all time.<br></h2>

			<p>Out of these 4 songs, I'll pick 2 that stand above the rest, and then pick the final 1 out of the last 2. I'm going to keep "Fast" because of <br>
			that <em>meaty</em> bass and simple lyrics. The next song I'll choose to move on to the final round will be "Help" because of the super sick<br>
			guitar riffs and general badass-iness of the sound.</p>
